# Duolance Screen Recorder
Duolance Screen Recorder is a chrome extension to capture and annotate your screen as a video, save it to your Google Drive and append the video link to a new to your Google Sheets.

As the original extension has a [GPLv3](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity/blob/master/LICENSE) license, so does this derivative work as well.

# Work in Progress

This extension is a work in progress. The readme will be updated once the MVP version is completed.

# Roadmap

- [] Implement saving to a specific Google Sheets via copy/pasted link/sheet id.
- [] Implement selecting which sheet to save via a UI selector.
- [] Add more todos.

## Original Work

Duolance Screen Recorder is based on the existing Screenity extension developed by [Alyssa X](https://alyssax.com)

As the original extension has a [GPLv3](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity/blob/master/LICENSE) license, so does this derivative work as well. Special thanks to [@alyssaxuu](https://github.com/alyssaxuu) for developing a great screen recorder extension and humbly sharing it.
